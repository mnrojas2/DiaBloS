Introduction
============

Nowadays, more and more software tools based on visual diagrammatic programming are being used. These tools have the advantage of facilitating the user the implementation of complex system models, allowing to visualize the interactions between subcomponents of the system. Examples of these tools can be found from systems adopted by the industry such as LabView from National Instruments, Simulink from Mathworks, Modellica, Scicos. There are even tools for the development of computational thinking and STEM skills that employ programming programs based on block diagrams such as Lego EV3. However, there are no open libraries for the development of such tools on platforms such as Python, nor a detailed exposition of methodologies for processing block diagrams and executing the models they represent, since in general existing software uses proprietary methodologies.

For this reason, the contribution of the present work is the approach of the main algorithms for block diagram processing and the development of an open software library for Python that is made available to the community to be used both as a computational tool and as a basis for the development of other graphical modeling systems based on block diagrams, as well as an educational tool that can be useful in courses of modeling and simulation of dynamic systems.
